# Air-Quality-Index-Hyderabad
This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization of Air Quality Index (AQI) in Hyderabad, focusing on key pollutants like PM2.5, NO2, CO, and O3. The goal is to analyze historical AQI trends, identify pollution hotspots, and explore potential correlations with public health data 
This project analyzes the Air Quality Index (AQI) in Hyderabad, focusing on key pollutants like PM2.5, NO2, CO, and O3. The goal is to study pollution trends, identify high-risk areas, and explore correlations between air quality and public health.

🔍 Key Features

Data Collection: Scraping and aggregating daily AQI data from reliable sources (CPCB).

Data Cleaning & Processing: Handling missing values, timestamp formatting, and normalizing pollutant levels.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifying seasonal trends, peak pollution hours, and geographic variations.

Public Health Correlation: Studying links between AQI levels and respiratory illness rates.

Visualization Dashboard: Interactive Power BI  dashboard for AQI monitoring.

📊 Tech Stack

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

SQL (For structured data storage)

Power BI (For interactive visualizations)

BeautifulSoup / Selenium (For web scraping AQI data)
