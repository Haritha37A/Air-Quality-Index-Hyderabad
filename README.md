# Air-Quality-Index-Hyderabad
This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization of Air Quality Index (AQI) in Hyderabad, focusing on key pollutants like PM2.5, NO2, CO, and O3. The goal is to analyze historical AQI trends, identify pollution hotspots, and explore potential correlations with public health data 
This project analyzes the Air Quality Index (AQI) in Hyderabad, focusing on key pollutants like PM2.5, NO2, CO, and O3. The goal is to study pollution trends, identify high-risk areas, and explore correlations between air quality and public health.

Objectives:
The main objective of this project is to analyze air quality data to understand pollution levels, identify key pollutants, and assess their impact on  the environment. This project aims to provide actionable insights through data-driven analysis and visualization.

🔍 Key Features

Data Collection: Scraping and aggregating daily AQI data from reliable sources (CPCB website).

Data Cleaning & Processing: Handling missing values, timestamp formatting, and normalizing pollutant levels.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifying seasonal trends, peak pollution hours, and geographic variations.


Visualization Dashboard: Interactive Power BI  dashboard for AQI monitoring.

📊 Tech Stack

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

SQL (For structured data storage)

Power BI (For interactive visualizations)

BeautifulSoup / Selenium (For web scraping AQI data)

Conclusions:
The primary contributors to high AQI values were PM2.5 and PM10, which are mainly caused by vehicular emissions, industrial activities, and construction.
High NO2 levels were observed in traffic-congested areas, indicating a direct link between vehicle emissions and air pollution.
SO2 and CO levels were relatively lower, but still posed risks in industrial zones.
